      <h2>What is Git? </h2>
      <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  This acts as a medium between the local and remote repository, with the capability of pulling previous versions and comparing program through simple commands.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
        <p>Its important to have source code version control system in order to record changes to a file or set of files over time.  This allows for a capability to recall specific versions for any reasons bugs and/or erros occur within the current version of code.  Additionally, the version control allows for analyzing changes over time and/or what introduce a new error, etc. </p>

      <h2>Describe the following terms: 1) local repo, 2) remote repo, 3) how to use GIT in Team project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p> Local Repository: This repository is stored on the local / physical computer with all the remote repoâ€™s history.  Most of the work, code changes, and inputs occur on the local repository.  Once updated, the updates would be pushed on the local and pulled on the remote repository. </p>

        <p> Remote Repository: A remote repository is the centralized server where team members are able to access the server to for updates.  No single person and/or team has the remote repository on their physical computer.  In most instances, the team members will push the commits or information. </p>

        <p> How to use GIT in Team Projects: GIT allows each team member to clone the repository and work on the respective respository onr their local computer without impacting the remote respository.  Additionally, each team member is able to work on the same project without impacting others as their local copy or clone is on their workspace. </p>
